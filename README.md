AERSP 304 Project 1

Project by Nicholas Giampetro, Craig Stenstrom, Payton Glynn

Originally completed for AERSP 304 on 3/4/2023, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

MATLAB program that utilizes ODE45 to numerically analyzes the CRTBP Lynapunov orbits at L2 and L4 in the Earth-Moon system. Also utilizes a linearized solution and compares that to the ODE45 results.
